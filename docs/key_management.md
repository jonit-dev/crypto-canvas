# Key Management - Best Practices

- **Secure Storage**: Store the encryption key in a secure location, such as a safe or a hidden compartment. Avoid exposing the key in public code or unsecured locations.
- **Separate Locations**: Keep the key separate from the image with the hidden message. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access to both the data and the key.
- **Regular Key Rotation**: Consider updating the encryption key periodically to maintain security and reduce the risk of key compromise.
- **Key Backup**: Ensure you have a secure backup of the encryption key in case of loss or damage.
