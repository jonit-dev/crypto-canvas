# Use Cases

## Storing Seed Phrases

Steganography can be used to securely store seed phrases or sensitive information within images. The encrypted text can be hidden in innocent-looking family pictures or other images, providing an additional layer of security.

## Example Use Case: Family Pictures and Secure Key Storage

Consider a scenario where you store family pictures on a pendrive, but one of the images contains a hidden seed phrase. To secure the encryption key, you store it on another pendrive, which you keep in a separate location, such as a safe or a hidden compartment. This approach ensures that even if someone finds the family pictures, they would need the key to decrypt the hidden message.
